## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed implementation of detailed educational content for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as done. The content now includes comprehensive chapters for all four modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) with learning objectives, real-world context, technical content, code snippets, diagram descriptions, and summaries. Each chapter meets the 800-1200 word requirement with professional, university-level technical writing. The sidebar configuration has been updated to properly organize the content, and all content follows Docusaurus markdown conventions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed comprehensive educational content implementation covering all required topics (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) with proper structure and depth
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests required for documentation content
- 📁 Files: Updated all 12 documentation files plus tasks tracking file and sidebar configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for content review, deployment, or additional feature development
- 🧠 Reflection: All implementation tasks completed successfully, content meets specified requirements for educational excellence

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Content review and validation by subject matter experts
