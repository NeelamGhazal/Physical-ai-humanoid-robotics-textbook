## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task list for UI/UX enhancements implementation. The tasks.md file includes 51 specific tasks organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallelization opportunities. The tasks are organized into 7 phases: Setup (3 tasks), Foundational (6 tasks), User Story 1 (Enhanced Visual Experience - 8 tasks), User Story 2 (Professional Typography - 7 tasks), User Story 3 (Responsive and Accessible Design - 9 tasks), User Story 4 (Enhanced Navigation - 13 tasks), and Polish phase (6 tasks). Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, and file paths. The tasks align with the 4 user stories from the specification with proper priorities (P1 for User Stories 1 and 2, P2 for User Stories 3 and 4).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task list with 51 specific implementation tasks organized by user story for UI/UX enhancements
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests required for task generation
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md file with comprehensive implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase (/sp.implement)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized tasks by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature
